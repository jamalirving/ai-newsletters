# Contributions
This is a public list of ai related research and newsletters.  I will continue to update it.  It would be great to have others create some pull requests of additional resources that are not listed in this repo already.  One day, I would like to create an agentic workflow that can consumes all AI related content in this repo and creates embeddings in a Vector Store to perform Retreival Augmented Generation app that can answer, curate, and find sourced and verified solutions to one's AI related and software development questions.
